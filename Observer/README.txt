Observer Design Pattern

Observer pattern is used when there is one-to-many relationship between objects such as, if one object is monitoring an individual stock price (for example) and that price changes, other objects will need to be notified of the change to enable them to act. 

Define a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
Encapsulate the core (or common or engine) components in a Subject abstraction, and the variable (or optional or user interface) components in an Observer hierarchy.
The "View" part of Model-View-Controller.

Observer pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.
